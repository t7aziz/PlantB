A mobile application developed using React to interface with a plant care system. Displays real-time sensor readings from an Arduino and allows users to control the lighting and watering of the plant care system using WiFi.

Has two modes:

    Auto mode
    Manual mode

In auto mode, users have the ability to make changes to the control system used to activate the watering and lighting, including light sensitivity and colour, as well as watering frequency and amount.
